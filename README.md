Overview: We took three data sets, amount of fires , average daily vehicle traffic, and crime counts per neighbohoods to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, based on safety. The amount of fires and crime is overall safety but less traffic is better for children and the elderly.

Project Introduction: 
  To Determine the Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh we decided to use safety information. We thought about multiple approachs including best neighborhood for children or people without cars, based on data of schools or walkable distances. However, we decided to base our answer on safety, becuase we thought it was a universal attribute that all people looked for in neighborhoods. 

The Metric: 
  Are metric was based on the least amout of crimes, fires, and traffic in the neighborhoods. We thought that the less amount of these safety restrictures per neighborhood, the better the neighborhood is overall. We used datasets on amount of crimes per neighborhood, amount of fires per neighborhood, and the daily vehicle traffier per neighborhood. 

The Best Neighborhood: 
  Based on our metric, we have concluded that the Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Mt.Oliver Nieghborhood. We think this is the best neighborhood becuase based on a combination of our three data sets, we have determine that this neighborhood overall gets the least amount of fires, crime, and daily traffic. Individual we used our codes to rank the the data sets from least to most fires, least to most amount of crime, and lest to most daily traffic. We then combined this data into one code, and combined averages of information to determine the overall best neighborhood. 

Conclusion: 

  Aisling: I feel the our data driven decision for the best neighborhood is the same way i would determine my favorite neighborhood. I am from Pittsburgh, and even though Mt.Oliver Neighborhood is not my favorite nieghborhood in pittsburgh, Fox Chaple is, I still think the safety aspect is very impotant and its how i will determine where i want to live in the future. 
  
  Nathan: I believe that our data driven solution, based off fire, crime and traffic is a perfect metric to describe the perfect neighborhood as it encompsulates a neighborhood that is quiet and safe, perfect for raising a young family. The low fire rate ensures your house is built well and that fires won't easily spread to your house, low crime means a low rate of being robbed or something else happening and low traffic means its safer for kids to play outside. 
    
  Ragull: As a potential neighbor, especially one looking to settle in, safety is of utmost importance. Whether it be for deciding long term stay or protection young ones, it is very important to make sure the neighborhood one moves into is sustainable. So, we decided on finding the safest neighborhood as the best. By using metrics like fire occurences, crime rates, and traffic rates, we were able to find the least dangerous neighborhood, which we concluded as the best neighborhood to live in. I believe this is a great metric and should be a deciding factor when thinking about moving into an area. While I still love North Oakland, I will definitely look into moving into safer neighborhoods like Mount Oliver if I decide to settle into Pittsburgh for a longer period of time.
